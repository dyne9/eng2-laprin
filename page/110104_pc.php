                            The subfacial breast augmentation is the most recent breast reconstruction method developed by Dr. Ruth Graf,<br>
                            the head of the Brazilian Breast Surgery, in 2004. It is the latest method of breast surgery that<br>
                            utilizes both the advantages of submammary implantation and intramusclar implantation.
							<br><br>
							It basically inserts the implant above the breast muscles and between the fascia, tissue that stabilizes <br>
							and separate surrounding muscles, and muscular fat tissue. 
							<br><br>
							It requires highly skillful surgeons to perform the delicate and<br>
							complex fascia separation compared to conventional methods used in other hospitals. <br><br>
							
							Conventional intramuscular implantation has a shorter operation time compared to subfascial implantation but,<br>
							while there may be some variance between hospitals, <br>
							there are cases where the separation is performed with a simple blunt (dull) dissection.

                            It is patient friendly technique. In the case of the usual intramuscular insertion method,<br>
							resection the lower part of the breast muscle was inevitably for muscle separation. Not only that,<br>
							for 1 to 2 weeks after surgery, sternum (rib) under the breast muscles will be inflamed, <br>
							accompanied by pain due to surgical hemorrhaging and damaging from surgical instruments which are the two most common causes of severe pain
							
							This results in a long recovery period and discomfort. <br>
							Subfascial implantation does not require a surgical procedure that causes these two pains,<br>
							resulting in only a mild discomfort similar to muscle aches after straining exercise and a short recovery period.
							<br><br>
							Furthermore, overall breast shape is very natural and<br>
							good surgical results are obtained even for moderate to severely sagging breast
							<br><br>
							For those who have very poor or thin breast tissues, we use the intramuscular implantation method (double plane method). <br>
							However, we do not recommend intramuscular implantation for those who are suitable for subfascial implantation

                            Assuming that the surgery went well without any complications, no inflammation/hemorrhage/tissue damage, <br>
							body reacts to the inserted implant by surrounding it with bio-film (a kind of scar tissue). <br>
							Typical silicone or smoothed implants causes bio-film to form fibrous tissues (hard and tough).<br>
							And the thicker the fibrous tissue are, harder and more rigid the breast becomes. <br>
							Amount of fibrous film formation determines the texture of the breast implant. <br><br>
							
							Microthane implants made up of polyurethane coating prevents fibrous film formation around the<br>
							implant compared to silicone or smoothed implants. <br>
							This completely different kind of film formation is witnessed via the result of a very soft breast.

                            In general, breast augmentation by intramuscular implantation may cause complications such as the rotation <br>
							of the water drop implants due to the movement of the muscles and shifting of the implant position to up, down, <br>
							or lower side due to the contraction of the muscle. <br>
							This can result in unnatural breast shape and hence they recommend patients to <br>
							limit the muscle movement until the implant is fully anchored.<br><br>
							
							In contrast, subfascial implantation is not affected by the muscles movement during the exercise, <br>
							so you can move your arms freely after the surgery.

                            Our body feels pain thru sensory nerves. Post-operative pain is caused by inflamed tissues during <br>
							it’s healing process in the first week of the surgery 
							<br><br>
							Generally the intensity of pain tends to be greater when it comes from the internal organs and<br>
							pain from inflammation is least severe. In the case of breast surgery by intramusclar implantation,<br>
							inflammation of the sternum (rib) underneath the muscle is inevitable and the resulting pain may be similar to a rib fracture.
							<br><br>
							Our subfascial implantation does not cause inflammation of the sternum,<br>
							resulting in only a mild discomfort similar to muscle aches after exercising.

                            After the breast surgery, most common cause for unnatural or deformed shape is due to capsular contracture or<br>

							size of the implant was not selected for the individual. Conversely, if you do not have any of these side effects,<br>

                            All three implants are silicone-based, and the tissue reaction is similar when inserted into our body.<br>
							Overall shape and texture of the breast after surgery depends on the<br>
							formation of a fibrous tissue around the silicone textured implant. 
							<br><br>
							For silicone-textured implants, the rate of occurrence of capsular contracture is similar and<br>

							research papers show that re-operation due to cosmetic reasons varies from<br>

                            The microthane breast implant is completely different from the conventional silicone-based breast implant,<br>

							<br><br>
							From October, 2017 to January, 2019, we conducted a survey on 150 patients who underwent microthane subfascial breast augmentation. <br>
							We found more than 90% of patients were very satisfied with the outcome in terms of breast shape and size.<br>
							There was no case of grade 2 or higher capsular contracture occurrence or deformity due to implant rotation.
							<br><br>
							Among the 150 patients, 65 patients who used different types of implant had <br>
							reoperation due occurrence of capsular contracture, implant rupture, or shifted position from their first.<br>
							These 65 patients had re-operation using microthane implant in various sizes ranging from 240 to 390cc, with average being 310cc.
